# Getting Started with Cedra
Cedra is the first community-owned blockchain built on the Move language that lets anyone spin up and govern their own sovereign networks. Designed as a public good, Cedra fuses protocol development, funding, and growth into open collaboration among core contributors, a non-profit foundation, and a worldwide guild of builders.

:::


### 1. 📋 Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the necessary development tools installed.

[**Install Rust and Node.js →**](/getting-started/libs)

### 2. 🛠️ Install CLI
Once prerequisites are ready, install the Cedra Command Line Interface, which is essential for all development activities.

[**CLI Installation Guide →**](/getting-started/cli)

### 3. 🔧 Set Up IDE Extension
Install Move language support for your preferred IDE to get syntax highlighting, code completion, and error detection.

**For VSCode:**
- Install the [Move Language Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MoveBit.aptos-move-analyzer) from the marketplace

**For JetBrains IDEs:**
- Install the [Move Language Plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/14721-move-on-aptos) for IntelliJ IDEA, CLion, or other JetBrains IDEs

### 4. 🚀 Initialize Your First Project
Create your first Move project to start building smart contracts.

```bash
cedra move init --name first_smart_contract
```

This command creates a new Move project with the basic structure needed for smart contract development.
