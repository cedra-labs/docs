# Create and Deploy Your Custom Gas Token

This guide walks you through the complete journey of creating a custom token that can be used for gas payments on the Cedra network. By following these steps, you'll deploy a fungible asset, configure it for gas payments, and enable users to transact without needing CED tokens.

:::info Prerequisites
Before proceeding, ensure you have:
- Completed the [Cedra CLI installation](/getting-started/cli)
- Obtained test tokens from the [faucet](/getting-started/faucet)
- Basic understanding of Move programming language
- Rust toolchain installed on your system
:::

Your gas token journey begins with creating a Move module that defines your fungible asset. This module will specify your token's properties and initialize it on the blockchain.

Create a new directory for your project, add the token module:

```bash
# Create project structure
mkdir my-gas-token
cd my-gas-token
mkdir sources
```

Now create `sources/my_token.move`:

```move
module creator::usdt {
    use cedra_framework::stablecoin;
    use std::string;

    // Initialize your token with the stablecoin framework
    // This creates a fungible asset with standard functionality
    fun init_module(signer: &signer) {
        stablecoin::create(
            signer,
            b"USDT",                              // Token symbol
            string::utf8(b"Tether USD"),          // Full name
            6,                                     // Decimals (1 USDT = 1,000,000 units)
            string::utf8(b"https://example.com/usdt.png"),  // Icon URL
            string::utf8(b"https://tether.to")    // Project URL
        );
    }
}
```

**What's happening:** This module creates a new fungible asset using Cedra's stablecoin framework:
- **Token Symbol**: Short identifier (USDT) used in commands and displays
- **Decimals**: Precision of 6 means 1 USDT = 1,000,000 smallest units
- **Metadata**: Icon and project URLs for wallet and explorer displays
- **Auto-initialization**: The `init_module` function runs automatically when deployed

## Create Your Token Owner Profile

Every token needs an owner account that controls its deployment and initial configuration. Let's create a dedicated profile for your token management.

```bash
# Create a new profile specifically for token ownership
# This generates a new keypair and account on the selected network (use Devnet)
cedra init --profile owner
```

**What's happening:** This command creates:
- **New Keypair**: Unique cryptographic identity for your token owner
- **Account Address**: On-chain address that will deploy and control the token
- **Profile Configuration**: Saved in `~/.cedra/config.yaml` for future use
- **Initial Funding**: Automatic faucet request for test tokens

**Important:** Save the displayed account address - you'll need it for the next step.

## Configure Your Move Project

With your owner account created, it's time to set up the Move project configuration that links your module to your account.

Create a `Move.toml` file in your project root:

```toml
[package]
name = "MyGasToken"
version = "0.0.1"

[addresses]
std = "0x1"
cedra_framework = "0x1"
creator = "YOUR_OWNER_ADDRESS"  # Replace with address from previous step

[dependencies]
CedraFramework = {
    git = "https://github.com/cedra-labs/cedra-network",
    subdir = "cedra-move/framework/cedra-framework",
    rev = "devnet"  # Use "testnet" or "mainnet" as appropriate
}
```

**What's happening:** This configuration file:
- **Links your module** to your owner account address
- **Imports Cedra Framework** for stablecoin and fungible asset functionality
- **Specifies network version** to ensure compatibility
- **Defines module namespace** under your creator address

## Publish Your Token Module

Now it's time to deploy your token to the blockchain. This step compiles your Move code and publishes it on-chain.

```bash
# Compile and publish your token module to the blockchain
# This creates your token and makes it available for use
cedra move publish --profile owner
```

**What's happening:** This publishes your token module:
- **Compiles Move code** and checks for errors
- **Deploys to blockchain** using your owner account
- **Executes init_module** automatically on deployment
- **Returns metadata address** for your token

**Important:** Save the transaction hash from the output - you'll need it to find your metadata address for the primary storage step.

## Configure Gas Payment Authorization

Your token exists on-chain, but it needs permission to be used for gas payments. This step grants the network admin the ability to process gas payments in your token.

```bash
# Grant the network admin permission to use your token for gas payments
# Replace ADMIN_ADDRESS with the network-specific admin
cedra move run \
    --function-id 0x1::stablecoin::update_authorized_caller \
    --args address:ADMIN_ADDRESS string:"USDT" \
    --profile owner
```

**Example with devnet admin:**
```bash
cedra move run \
    --function-id 0x1::stablecoin::update_authorized_caller \
    --args address:3c9124028c90111d7cfd47a28fae30612e397d115c7b78f69713fb729347a77e string:"USDT" \
    --profile owner
```

**What's happening:** This authorizes the network's gas payment system to:
- **Deduct your token** from users' accounts for gas fees
- **Process gas payments** during transaction execution
- **Distribute fees** to validators in your token
- **Handle refunds** for unused gas

## Mint Your Initial Token Supply

With permissions configured, you can now create your token's initial supply. This provides the tokens needed for testing and initial distribution.

```bash
# Mint tokens to a recipient address
# Amount is in smallest units (with 6 decimals: 1000000 = 1 USDT)
cedra move run \
    --function-id 0x1::stablecoin::mint \
    --args address:RECIPIENT_ADDRESS string:"USDT" u64:AMOUNT \
    --profile owner
```

**Example minting 1000 USDT to your owner:**
```bash
cedra move run \
    --function-id 0x1::stablecoin::mint \
    --args address:35c82a4fbf233f793b49de20212872ada755073f2a5b74c00ab4661da1220685 string:"USDT" u64:1000000000 \
    --profile owner
```

**What's happening:** This creates new tokens:
- **Increases total supply** by the specified amount
- **Credits recipient account** with newly minted tokens
- **Updates on-chain state** immediately
- **Emits mint event** for indexers and explorers

## Grant Minting Permissions

To enable flexible token management, you'll grant minting permissions to the network admin. This allows for future token distribution without requiring your owner key.

```bash
# Add the network admin as an authorized minter
# This enables administrative minting for liquidity and operations
cedra move run \
    --function-id 0x1::stablecoin::add_minter \
    --args address:ADMIN_ADDRESS string:"USDT" \
    --profile owner
```

**Example with testnet admin:**
```bash
cedra move run \
    --function-id 0x1::stablecoin::add_minter \
    --args address:3c9124028c90111d7cfd47a28fae30612e397d115c7b78f69713fb729347a77e string:"USDT" \
    --profile owner
```

**What's happening:** This permission allows the admin to:
- **Mint additional tokens** for operational needs
- **Provide liquidity** to users who need tokens for gas
- **Handle edge cases** without requiring owner intervention
- **Support network growth** as usage increases

## Create Primary Storage for Gas Operations

Your token needs a primary storage mechanism for efficient gas payment processing. This step initializes the storage structure required for gas operations.
You need to find your token's metadata address from your token publishing transaction:

1. **Get your transaction hash** from when you published your token module (the `cedra move publish` command earlier)
2. **Navigate to Cedrascan**:
   - For devnet: https://cedrascan.com/?network=devnet
   - For testnet: https://cedrascan.com/?network=testnet
3. **Search for your transaction** by entering the transaction hash in the search box
4. **Click on the "Changes" tab** in the transaction details page
5. **Look for the write_resource entry** with type `0x1::fungible_asset::Metadata`
6. **Copy the address** shown in that entry - this is your metadata address

**Example:**
If your publish transaction hash was `0xc366f36fbcaaf0004885ae15867d1d8d42778ee324066e11317d2f9564f54cb6`:
- Go to: https://cedrascan.com/txn/0xc366f36fbcaaf0004885ae15867d1d8d42778ee324066e11317d2f9564f54cb6/changes?network=devnet
- In the Changes tab, find the entry with:
  - Type: `write_resource`
  - Resource: `0x1::fungible_asset::Metadata`
- The address field (e.g., `0xba98883c13dfb8f208440f1ad20be4d82cabc5f716ea0f80748e095e3c5a3296`) is your metadata address

### Running the Transfer Command

Now use the metadata address you found above in the transfer command:

```bash
# Transfer tokens to create the primary fungible store
# Use the metadata address you found from Cedrascan
cedra move run \
    --function-id 0x1::primary_fungible_store::transfer \
    --type-args 0x1::fungible_asset::Metadata \
    --args address:METADATA_ADDRESS address:ADMIN_ADDRESS u64:1000 \
    --profile owner
```

**Example with actual addresses:**
```bash
cedra move run \
    --function-id 0x1::primary_fungible_store::transfer \
    --type-args 0x1::fungible_asset::Metadata \
    --args address:0xba98883c13dfb8f208440f1ad20be4d82cabc5f716ea0f80748e095e3c5a3296 \
           address:3c9124028c90111d7cfd47a28fae30612e397d115c7b78f69713fb729347a77e \
           u64:1000 \
    --profile owner
```

**What's happening:** This step:
- **Creates primary store** structure for your token
- **Initializes storage** for the admin account
- **Enables gas processing** without individual approvals
- **Prepares for whitelisting** in the next steps

**Note:** The metadata address uniquely identifies your token on the blockchain and is created when you publish your token module.

## Verify Your Token Deployment

Before proceeding to whitelisting, let's verify your token is correctly deployed and balances are as expected.

You can query the indexer to see all token balances for an address using Hasura GraphiQL:

**Indexer Endpoints:**
- **Devnet**: https://cloud.hasura.io/public/graphiql?endpoint=https://graphql-devnet.cedra.dev/v1/graphql
- **Testnet**: https://cloud.hasura.io/public/graphiql?endpoint=https://graphql.cedra.dev/v1/graphql

**Query to run:**
```graphql
query CheckTokenBalance {
  current_fungible_asset_balances_new(
    where: {
      owner_address: {_eq: "0x35c82a4fbf233f793b49de20212872ada755073f2a5b74c00ab4661da1220685"}
    }
  ) {
    amount_v2
    asset_type_v2
    owner_address
    metadata {
      asset_type
      decimals
      creator_address
      name
      symbol
      token_standard
    }
  }
}
```

Replace the `owner_address` value with your actual address to check your token balance.

or check balance using CLI

```bash
# View token balance for any address
# Replace addresses with your actual values
cedra move view \
    --function-id 0x1::stablecoin::balance \
    --args address:TOKEN_ADDRESS address:USER_ADDRESS string:"USDT"
```

**What's happening:** These verification methods:
- **Confirm token exists** on the blockchain
- **Show current balances** after minting
- **Verify metadata** is correctly configured
- **Ensure ready** for whitelisting

## Whitelist Your Token for Gas Payments

Finally, your token needs to be added to the network's whitelist of approved gas payment tokens. The process varies by network.

:::note
Mainnet requires a governance proposal. Documentation for the governance process is coming soon.
:::

For **Testnet** and **Devnet** admin can directly whitelist your token

### Next Steps

Your custom gas token opens new possibilities:
- **Onboard users** without requiring CED tokens
- **Integrate with wallets** that support custom gas
- **Monitor usage** through the indexer
