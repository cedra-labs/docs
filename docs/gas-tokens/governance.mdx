# Gas Token Governance

:::info Coming Soon
The governance process for custom gas tokens is currently under development. Full documentation will be available soon.
:::

## Overview

On mainnet, custom gas tokens will require governance approval through community voting. This ensures only high-quality, secure tokens are approved for gas payments.

## Current Status

### Testnet and Devnet
For testing purposes, tokens can be whitelisted directly by the network admin. See the [deployment guide](/gas-tokens/custom-gas-tokens#whitelist-your-token-for-gas-payments) for instructions.

### Mainnet
Mainnet will require:
- Community proposal submission
- Validator and delegator voting
- Minimum quorum and approval thresholds
- Automatic execution upon approval

## What's Coming

The complete governance documentation will include:
- Proposal structure and requirements
- Voting mechanics and timelines
- Security audit requirements
- Economic impact assessments
- Integration with existing Cedra governance

## Get Started on Testnet

While governance is being finalized, you can:
1. Deploy and test your token on testnet
2. Request admin whitelisting for immediate testing
3. Gather community feedback for your future proposal
4. Prepare documentation and audit reports

For testnet whitelisting, follow the instructions in our [Custom Gas Token Guide](/gas-tokens/custom-gas-tokens).
