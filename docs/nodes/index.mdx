# Cedra Nodes Overview

import { CardList } from '@site/src/components/CardList';

The Cedra network consists of three node types: validator nodes, validator fullnodes (VFNs), and public fullnodes (PFNs). To participate in consensus, you are required to run a validator node and stake the minimum 100 000 amount of CEDRA tokens. VFNs and PFNs are not required to participate in consensus, but they are necessary to distribute blockchain data and enable ecosystem services, e.g., indexing, querying, and RESTful API services (accessible via the Cedra testnet API at https://testnet.cedra.dev/v1). VFNs can only be run by validator operators, while PFNs can be run by anyone. You can learn more about the different types of nodes in the next sections. This section provides detailed, step-by-step instructions on how to deploy and operate Cedra nodes in different environments. It also describes everything you need to stake and participate in consensus and governance through the community-driven model that distinguishes Cedra as a public good infrastructure.
