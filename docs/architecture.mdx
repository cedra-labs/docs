# Cedra Architecture

Cedra couples the linear‑type Move VM with Block‑STM parallel execution and a pipelined HotStuff variant (CedraBFT) to deliver 10 k+ TPS and  less than 1 s deterministic finality. State versions are hashed into a Sparse Merkle Tree, enabling light‑client proofs and fast sync. On‑chain governance hot‑swaps modules, VM configs, and consensus rules; hook APIs surface governance events. Native sub‑chains, a streaming indexer, and a VRF‑backed randomness oracle are built‑in. Resource‑safe token/NFT standards plus zero‑copy account storage give developers safe, upgrade‑friendly primitives atop a vertically integrated L1 stack.
