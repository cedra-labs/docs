Cedra employs sophisticated cryptographic proofs to ensure data integrity and enable trustless verification using Merkle Tree Structure. These proofs are essential for verifying the [state transitions](/concepts/transactions/states) created by transactions without trusting intermediaries.

```mermaid
graph BT
    T1[Transaction 1] --> H1[Hash 1]
    T2[Transaction 2] --> H2[Hash 2]
    T3[Transaction 3] --> H3[Hash 3]
    T4[Transaction 4] --> H4[Hash 4]

    H1 --> I1[Internal Hash 1-2]
    H2 --> I1
    H3 --> I2[Internal Hash 3-4]
    H4 --> I2

    I1 --> Root[Root Hash - Version 4]
    I2 --> Root
```

Each new transaction adds a leaf, and the root hash provides a succinct commitment to the entire transaction history.

### Proof Types

**Transaction Inclusion Proof**: Proves a specific transaction exists in the blockchain at a particular version.

**State Proof**: Verifies the current value of any account or resource without trusting the data provider.

**Event Proof**: Confirms that specific events were emitted during transaction execution.

### Verification Process

The verification process allows clients to independently verify blockchain data:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Fullnode
    participant Proof System

    Client->>Fullnode: Request data with proof
    Fullnode->>Fullnode: Gather data
    Fullnode->>Proof System: Generate proof
    Proof System->>Fullnode: Merkle proof
    Fullnode->>Client: Data + Proof
    Client->>Client: Verify proof
    Client->>Client: Trust data if valid
```

## Trust Model

With cryptographic proofs, clients can:
- Verify data without trusting the fullnode
- Detect any tampering or omission
- Ensure consistency across different data providers
- Maintain security even with untrusted intermediaries

This architecture ensures that every state change is authorized, verifiable, and permanent, providing the security and reliability essential for a production blockchain system.
