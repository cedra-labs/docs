## üìö Learn by Building

The best way to master the Cedra TypeScript SDK is by building real projects. These guides walk you through complete implementations:

### Getting Started
- **[Your First Transaction](/getting-started/tx#creating-your-first-transaction)** - Step-by-step tutorial using TypeScript SDK to send your first CED tokens
- **[Build a Counter Contract](/getting-started/counter)** - Create and interact with your first smart contract
- **[Get Test Tokens](/getting-started/faucet)** - Fund your account for testing

### Token Development
- **[Fungible Asset Guide](/guides/first-fa)** - Create your own token with minting, burning, and transfer capabilities
- **[NFT Contract Walkthrough](/guides/first-nft)** - Build a complete NFT collection with minting and marketplace features

### DeFi Applications
- **[Build a DEX](/guides/dex)** - Implement a decentralized exchange with liquidity pools and swapping
- **[Fee Splitter Contract](/guides/fee-splitter)** - Automatically distribute payments among multiple recipients
- **[Escrow System](/guides/escrow)** - Create secure, time-locked payments for marketplaces

Each guide includes complete TypeScript code using the SDK, explanations of key concepts, and best practices.

## üîÑ Common Patterns

### Connection Management

When building applications, you'll want to reuse the same client connection throughout your app. Instead of creating multiple instances, establish one connection and share it:

```typescript
// Initialize once in your app
import { Cedra, CedraConfig, Network } from "@cedra-labs/ts-sdk";

const config = new CedraConfig({ network: Network.TESTNET });
export const client = new Cedra(config);
```

This pattern prevents connection overhead and ensures consistent configuration across your application. For production apps, consider implementing connection pooling and retry logic.

### Error Handling

Blockchain operations can fail for various reasons - insufficient funds, network issues, or smart contract errors. Good error handling is crucial for user experience.

Instead of letting errors crash your app, anticipate common failures:
- Check balances before transfers
- Simulate transactions before submission
- Provide clear error messages to users
- Implement retry logic for network failures

The SDK provides detailed error messages that help identify issues quickly. Always wrap blockchain operations in try-catch blocks and provide fallback behavior.

### Gas Optimization

Gas costs can vary significantly based on network congestion and transaction complexity. To optimize costs:

1. **Simulate first** - Always simulate to estimate costs before submission
2. **Batch operations** - Combine multiple operations when possible
3. **Time your transactions** - Submit during low-congestion periods
4. **Set appropriate limits** - Don't overpay with excessive gas limits

Remember that simple transfers are cheap (5-10 gas units) while complex DeFi operations can use thousands.
