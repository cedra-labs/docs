### What's in an Account?

Every Cedra account on-chain contains:
- **Sequence Number**: Current transaction count (like nonce in Ethereum)
- **Authentication Key**: Used to verify transaction signatures
- **Resources**: Data owned by the account (tokens, NFTs, etc.)
- **Modules**: Smart contracts deployed by this account

Unlike Ethereum where accounts exist as soon as you generate a keypair, Cedra uses a **lazy initialization** model:

| Aspect | Ethereum (EVM) | Cedra |
|--------|----------------|--------|
| **Account Creation** | Exists immediately | Created on first transaction |
| **Address Format** | 20 bytes (0x...) | 32 bytes (0x...) |
| **Balance Before Funding** | Can be queried (returns 0) | Account doesn't exist |
| **Gas Payment** | Only in ETH | Multiple tokens supported |
| **State Storage** | Global state tree | Resources owned by account |

**Off-chain vs On-chain**: When you generate an account, it only exists in your local environment. The account is created on-chain when it receives its first transaction or tokens.

**Resources**: Unlike EVM's global state, Cedra accounts own their data as "resources". Think of resources as objects that belong to specific accounts - like having a personal vault instead of entries in a shared ledger.

**Sequence Numbers**: Similar to Ethereum's nonce, but strictly sequential. Each transaction from an account must have the next sequence number.

### 🆕 Creating Your First Account

Generating a new account is straightforward. Remember, this only creates the account locally - it won't exist on-chain until it receives tokens or sends a transaction.

```typescript
import { Account } from "@cedra-labs/ts-sdk";

// Generate a new Ed25519 account (Cedra's default signature scheme)
const account = Account.generate();

// The account now has:
// - A unique address (32 bytes)
// - A public/private keypair
// - But does NOT exist on-chain yet

console.log("Address:", account.accountAddress.toString());
console.log("Public Key:", account.publicKey.toString());

// Save the private key securely - you'll need it to import the account later
const privateKeyHex = account.privateKey.toString();
```

:::warning Security First
**Never expose private keys in production code!** Use environment variables or secure key management services. The private key is shown here for educational purposes only.
:::

### 📥 Importing Existing Accounts

If you've previously created an account, you can import it using the private key:

```typescript
import { Account, Ed25519PrivateKey } from "@cedra-labs/ts-sdk";

// Your saved private key (64 hex characters)
const PRIVATE_KEY = process.env.CEDRA_PRIVATE_KEY;

// Recreate the account from the private key
const privateKey = new Ed25519PrivateKey(PRIVATE_KEY);
const account = Account.fromPrivateKey({ privateKey });

// The address and public key are derived from the private key
console.log("Restored address:", account.accountAddress.toString());
```

### 💰 Checking Balances

Here's how to check various token balances for an account:

```typescript
import { Cedra, CedraConfig, Network } from "@cedra-labs/ts-sdk";

const client = new Cedra(new CedraConfig({ network: Network.TESTNET }));

// Check if account exists on-chain first
try {
  // Get CED balance
  const cedBalance = await client.getAccountCoinAmount({
    accountAddress: account.accountAddress,
    coinType: "0x1::cedra_coin::CedraCoin",
  });

  console.log(`CED Balance: ${cedBalance / 100_000_000} CED`);

  // Check a custom token (if you have any)
  const customBalance = await client.getAccountCoinAmount({
    accountAddress: account.accountAddress,
    coinType: "0x123::usdc::USDC", // Example custom token
  });

  // Get all token balances at once
  const allCoins = await client.getAccountCoinsData({
    accountAddress: account.accountAddress,
  });

  console.log("All tokens:");
  allCoins.forEach(coin => {
    console.log(`- ${coin.asset_type}: ${coin.amount}`);
  });

} catch (error) {
  console.log("Account doesn't exist on-chain yet");
}
```

:::tip CoinStore Resources
Each token type requires a `CoinStore` resource in the account. This is automatically created when the account first receives that token type.
:::


### Querying Account Data

```typescript
// Get comprehensive account information
const accountInfo = await client.getAccountInfo({
  accountAddress: account.accountAddress,
});

console.log("Sequence Number:", accountInfo.sequence_number);
console.log("Auth Key:", accountInfo.authentication_key);

// Get all resources (tokens, NFTs, and other data)
const resources = await client.getAccountResources({
  accountAddress: account.accountAddress,
});

console.log(`Account owns ${resources.length} resource types`);

// Check if account has deployed any smart contracts
const modules = await client.getAccountModules({
  accountAddress: account.accountAddress,
});

if (modules.length > 0) {
  console.log("Deployed contracts:", modules.map(m => m.abi.name));
}
```

Resources are the key difference from EVM: instead of a global state where contracts track balances, each Cedra account directly owns its resources. This makes the ownership model clearer and more secure.
