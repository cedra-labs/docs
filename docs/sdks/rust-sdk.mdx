# 🚀 Rust SDK

Build high-performance blockchain applications with Cedra's native Rust SDK. Designed for system-level integrations, the SDK provides zero-cost abstractions and compile-time safety for production blockchain development. Whether you're building trading bots, validator tools, or infrastructure services, Rust gives you the performance and reliability you need.


#### Start Building in Minutes

```rust
use cedra_sdk::{Client, LocalAccount};

// That's it! You're ready to build on Cedra
let client = Client::new("https://testnet.cedra.dev");
let account = LocalAccount::generate(&mut rand::rngs::OsRng);
```

Ready to dive deeper? Let's explore what makes the Rust SDK powerful.

## 📦 Installation

Add the Cedra SDK to your Rust project by updating your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml title="Cargo.toml"
[dependencies]
cedra-sdk = { git = "https://github.com/cedra-labs/cedra-network", branch = "main" }

[patch.crates-io]
# Required cryptographic dependencies
merlin = { git = "https://github.com/cedra-labs/merlin" }
x25519-dalek = { git = "https://github.com/cedra-labs/x25519-dalek", branch = "zeroize_v1" }
```

Create a `.cargo/config.toml` file in your project root:

```toml title=".cargo/config.toml"
[build]
rustflags = ["--cfg", "tokio_unstable"]
```

:::tip Production Deployment
For production applications, pin to specific commit hashes to ensure reproducible builds:
```toml
cedra-sdk = { git = "https://github.com/cedra-labs/cedra-network", rev = "abc123..." }
```

## 🎯 Your First Transaction

Here's the complete flow of sending tokens on Cedra. This example demonstrates the core SDK capabilities:

```rust title="src/main.rs"
use cedra_sdk::{
    coin_client::CoinClient,
    rest_client::Client,
    types::LocalAccount,
};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<()> {
    // Connect to Cedra testnet
    let client = Client::new("https://testnet.cedra.dev");
    let coin_client = CoinClient::new(&client);

    // Generate two accounts locally
    let mut alice = LocalAccount::generate(&mut rand::rngs::OsRng);
    let bob = LocalAccount::generate(&mut rand::rngs::OsRng);

    // Transfer 0.01 CED (1,000,000 Octas)
    let txn_hash = coin_client
        .transfer(&mut alice, bob.address(), 1_000_000, None)
        .await?;

    println!("Transfer complete: 0x{}", txn_hash);
    Ok(())
}
```

That's it! The SDK handles all the complexity - sequence numbers, gas estimation, signing, and confirmation. Notice how Rust's type system ensures you can't make mistakes like sending to an invalid address or using the wrong amount format.

While our TypeScript SDK is perfect for web applications, the Rust SDK is your choice when performance and reliability are non-negotiable.
