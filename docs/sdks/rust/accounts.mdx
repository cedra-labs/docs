### What's in an Account?

Every Cedra account on-chain contains:
- **Sequence Number**: Current transaction count (prevents replay attacks)
- **Authentication Key**: Used to verify transaction signatures
- **Resources**: Data owned by the account (tokens, NFTs, etc.)
- **Modules**: Smart contracts deployed by this account

### 🆕 Creating Your First Account

Generating a new account is straightforward. Remember, this only creates the account locally - it won't exist on-chain until it receives tokens or sends a transaction.

```rust
use cedra_sdk::types::LocalAccount;
use rand::rngs::OsRng;

// Generate a new ED25519 account (Cedra's signature scheme)
let account = LocalAccount::generate(&mut OsRng);

// The account now has:
// - A unique address (32 bytes)
// - A public/private keypair
// - But does NOT exist on-chain yet

println!("Address: 0x{}", account.address());
println!("Public Key: 0x{}", hex::encode(account.public_key().to_bytes()));

// Save the private key securely - you'll need it to import the account later
let private_key_bytes = account.private_key().to_bytes();
```

The `OsRng` uses your operating system's secure random number generator, ensuring cryptographically secure key generation. The generated account is completely offline - no network calls are made.


Unlike Ethereum where accounts exist as soon as you generate a keypair, Cedra uses a **lazy initialization** model:

| Aspect | Ethereum (EVM) | Cedra |
|--------|----------------|--------|
| **Account Creation** | Exists immediately | Created on first transaction |
| **Address Format** | 20 bytes (0x...) | 32 bytes (0x...) |
| **Balance Before Funding** | Can be queried (returns 0) | Account doesn't exist |
| **Key Algorithm** | ECDSA (secp256k1) | ED25519 |
| **State Storage** | Global state tree | Resources owned by account |

**Off-chain vs On-chain**: When you generate an account, it only exists in your local environment. The account is created on-chain when it receives its first transaction or tokens.

**Resources**: Unlike EVM's global state, Cedra accounts own their data as "resources". Think of resources as objects that belong to specific accounts - like having a personal vault instead of entries in a shared ledger.

**ED25519 Cryptography**: Cedra uses ED25519 for faster signature verification and smaller key sizes compared to Ethereum's ECDSA. This means better performance and lower transaction costs.

### 📥 Importing Existing Accounts

If you've previously created an account, you can reconstruct it from the private key:

```rust
use cedra_sdk::types::LocalAccount;
use cedra_sdk::crypto::ed25519::Ed25519PrivateKey;

// Your saved private key (64 hex characters)
let private_key_hex = std::env::var("CEDRA_PRIVATE_KEY")?;

// Remove 0x prefix if present and decode
let key_bytes = hex::decode(private_key_hex.trim_start_matches("0x"))?;

// Recreate the account from the private key
let private_key = Ed25519PrivateKey::try_from(&key_bytes[..])?;
let account = LocalAccount::from_private_key(private_key, 0)?;

// The address and public key are deterministically derived
println!("Restored address: 0x{}", account.address());
```

The second parameter (`0`) is the initial sequence number. For imported accounts, you typically start with 0, but if the account has already sent transactions, you'll need to fetch the current sequence number from the blockchain.

### 💰 Checking Balances

Before checking balances, remember that the account must exist on-chain. Here's how to safely check balances and handle non-existent accounts:

```rust
use cedra_sdk::rest_client::Client;

let client = Client::new("https://testnet.cedra.dev");

// Check if account exists and get balance
match client.get_account_balance(account.address()).await {
    Ok(balance) => {
        // Convert from Octas to CED (1 CED = 100,000,000 Octas)
        let ced_amount = balance as f64 / 100_000_000.0;
        println!("Balance: {} CED", ced_amount);
    }
    Err(e) if e.to_string().contains("Account not found") => {
        println!("Account doesn't exist on-chain yet");
        println!("Send tokens to {} to create it", account.address());
    }
    Err(e) => {
        println!("Error checking balance: {}", e);
    }
}
```

Each token type on Cedra requires a `CoinStore` resource in the account. This resource is automatically created when the account first receives that token type. The native token (CED) uses the type `0x1::cedra_coin::CedraCoin`.

### 🔍 Querying Account Data

Get comprehensive information about an account's state:

```rust
// Get account information including sequence number
let account_info = client.get_account_info(address).await?;
println!("Sequence Number: {}", account_info.sequence_number);
println!("Auth Key: 0x{}", account_info.authentication_key);

// Get all resources owned by the account
let resources = client.get_account_resources(address).await?;
println!("Account owns {} resource types", resources.len());

// Check for specific resource (e.g., CoinStore)
let has_ced = resources.iter().any(|r|
    r.type_ == "0x1::coin::CoinStore<0x1::cedra_coin::CedraCoin>"
);

// Check if account has deployed any smart contracts
let modules = client.get_account_modules(address).await?;
if !modules.is_empty() {
    println!("Account has deployed {} modules", modules.len());
}
```

The sequence number is crucial for transaction ordering - it must match exactly when submitting transactions. The authentication key can change if the account rotates its keys, but the address remains constant.
